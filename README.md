Methodology to be followed:

This project is developed in Android Studio using Java code as the front end and the Room database as the backend. Instead of starting to write the code without any preparation, we may utilise the Java OOPS idea to build projects from tested, functional modules that communicate with one another, which results in a reduction in development time and increased productivity. Also, Java concepts such as Intents, bundles, etc. are used. Room is used in the backend due to its Solid information base across the board, start-to-finish advancement, and adaptability. Room provides an overlay layer on SQLite that allows for quick database access while accessing all of SQLite's features.
 
Nowadays, Room is recommended as a data persistence technique over SQLite databases. By minimizing boilerplate code and enabling compile-time SQL query validation, it makes it easier for project participants to interface with SQLite Database objects. Room is a library for object-relational mapping. Room will, in other words, map our database objects to Java objects. Room provides an abstraction layer on top of SQLite that allows for quick database access while accessing all of SQLite's features. XML is used to design the layout pages in Android Studio, such as buttons, texts, images, spinners, radio buttons, etc.
